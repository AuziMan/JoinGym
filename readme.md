# This is the Repository for Austin Drivers' JoinGym project.

### This project is being managed via Jira, and was encouraged from my Senior capstone project at GCU.

This application is aimed at fellow gym goes that are wanting to find others at their gym to work out with.

The general flow of the complete application will be:

- Create User profile
- Create Gym Profile
- User will 'Join' a gym that they are a member of and connect with others that wish to have their profile displayed.
