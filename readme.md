# This is the Repository for Austin Drivers' JoinGym project.


## This application is meant to connect fellow fitness enthusiats together in a very casual way. 

***

### The gym can be an intemidating environment for new or introverted members. Some people, (like myself) found it hard to connect with other people at a gym because of the focused environment. Finding a gym partner with similar goals as me both skyrocketed my progress and overall enjoyment of the gym. **However, this took longer than I think it should have, so for my capstone project I wanted to begin building an application that can connect all fitness enthusiats of all types.**

# Requirments:
## Here are some of the functional requirements I set for JoinGym:
___
### 1. Each user will create a profile that can be accessed later


### 2. A user must create a profile specifying three importatnt questions:

     a. Gym goals
     b. Gym or athletic experience
     c. Workout style preference (Alone or with others)

### 3. A user is able to view a variety of gyms and view the members of the gym they choose to join 


### 4. Once a user finds another member that has similar goals, they are able to echange socials and choose to workout together.

# JoinGym is currenly built utilizing PHP Laravel and Custom HTML+CSS which is connected to a relational database. 

    My goal was to get a functional foundation built that I can then convert peice by peice over to a more robust tec-stack (React-Native). 

### Object oriented programming (OOP) was paired with the Model, View, Controller (MVC) Architeture to have a balenced separation of concers. This assisted in both the building and debugguing process of creating the application.


``` ```
### JoinGym is currently not deployed to any cloud hosting services at this point. I am going to wait until a more robust version is developed before making the application avalible to a large group of members.

# What I leaned:

## Before beginning on JoinGym, I had some hands on experience with PHP Laravel. I knew I could get a functional application built without having to dive into a new technology and risk not completing an application within one semester.

### The majority of my knowlege was on the front end of the application. I was initially wanting to utilize bootstrap or some other front end framework, but I opted to take a dive into raw HTML+CSS so I can have a well rounded knowlege of how it works before relying on a framework. 

### Because of the Agile-based structure of the 451 and 452 classes, I also learned alot about project planning. Devoting an entire semester to researching, planning and implementation approach really gave me a strong sense of direction once it was time to start writing code.

## Of course things changed along the way, but I truly belive that since I had such a structured plan in place, I made much farther progress than I would have if I had neglected the planning phase.
